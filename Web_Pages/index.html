<h1>Transfer Learning for Can't Stop</h1>
<h3>Author: Daniel Marsh</h3>
<h3>Advisor: James Glenn</h3>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Many important tools in machine learning and artificial intelligence today were originally designed to play games. From Nimatron in 1940 to DeepMind’s AlphaStar in 2019, game-playing agents have always tested the limits of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This project takes its inspiration from this rich history and explores transfer learning through the lens of the board game Can’t Stop. This project applies transfer learning to three existing machine learning techniques and analyzes each technique’s ability to learn successful strategies when playing Can’t Stop.</p>

<p>This project implements three game-playing agents using Q-Learning, Long-Short Term Memory networks, and Autoencoder networks respectively. To experiment with transfer learning in each case, these game-playing agents are trained using information about a smaller version of Can’t Stop in which three-sided dice are used before being tested on the full version of the game in which six-sided dice are used. To carry out this testing, each agent simulates a large number of games against a variety of simple move selection algorithms. The main results of this project focus on the outcomes of games played against a random opponent, however data about the outcomes of games played against a simple logic algorithm is also included.</p>

<p>This project does not explore applying transfer learning between different games or the idea of a general game-playing agent; rather, the primary goal of this project is to analyze how well, if at all, a variety of machine learning techniques are able to apply transfer learning and generalize strategies between different versions of Can’t Stop.</p>
